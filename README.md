# First Time ?

```
npm install
grunt

```

# To specify the game folder

```
grunt --path ../gameFolder
```

# To use nwjs to build the game binaries:

```
grunt build --path ../gameFolder
```


 The "game" folder included in this project contains only the basic configs without any asset, so it won't run on it's own.
